# Hello, World! 👋

I'm **Sieun Kim**, a backend developer passionate about building scalable systems and solving real-world problems through clean, reliable code.

My journey began with a curiosity for how things work under the hood—from rooting phones in middle school to exploring network protocols and cloud infrastructure. Now, I’m on a mission to build **impactful and accessible services** that blend technical depth with thoughtful design.

I enjoy working on projects that matter—like improving access for transportation-vulnerable users, optimizing feed systems under high traffic, and leading green-tech platforms with real-time challenge tracking. Whether it’s collaborating on cloud-native architectures or fine-tuning authentication flows, I love diving deep into problems and finding elegant, efficient solutions.

Let’s build something meaningful together.

## ✨ My Values

- **Build with purpose**: I strive to create services that are not only functional but also meaningful for users.
- **Structure with care**: I value readability, maintainability, and thoughtful design in both code and system architecture.
- **Lead with empathy**: Clear communication and mutual respect are at the core of every successful team.

## 💼 How I work

I thrive in fast-paced environments where learning never stops. As the Backend Lead in multiple projects and a captain of the AWS Cloud Club, I’ve tackled everything from API bottlenecks to multi-AZ deployments. My favorite tools are Spring Boot, Redis, MySQL, and a good debugging session.

I believe growth happens when we share and reflect. That’s why I document my challenges, mentor others, and welcome constructive feedback.

Whether I'm scaling a service for 10,000+ users or guiding teammates through tech decisions, I aim to build **robust, user-centered systems** that stand the test of time.
